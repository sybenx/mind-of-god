This is a proposed simulation of humanity, taking available data and modeling AI individuals who accurately live our history organically. This simulation would be accessible and interactive, an individual in the simulation would be controllable, playable by a user.

One could live in and explore and participate in the economy of an age and culture. One could interact with the physical makeup of the world and manipulate it with human power. Splinters of history could be explored by jump starting or sabotaging periodic inventions, influencing and manipulating culture by propaganda, & murder of key individuals.

An increasingly accurate simulation would be developed by gleaning agreed upon information from commonly disagreeing sources. 

Simulation parity with the physics of reality would function by intelligent simplifying of robust simulation. 

Dynamic worldgen should be seed based, pursing a simulation that is vaguely accurate rather than precisely accurate.  The simulation should be deterministic.
